An approach to model employee attrition


Every organization suffers from attrition and like every other scenario, this problem can be broken down in many factors and their individual/combined effect on why an employee leaves the organization. Provided the understanding of the contributing factors, HR can better manage the direct/indirect costs associated with attrition.


Note-  We are not using the default .5 as cutoff decision boundry between positive negative classes. A different approach using f1-score is used to find the vale that maximize the actual ratio.
